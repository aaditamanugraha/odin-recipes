      <h2>What Is a Beignet?</h2>
      <p>
        A beignet is traditionally a deep-fried pastry. There are a few
        different types of beignets, but the most popular variety in the U.S. is
        topped with an ample amount of powdered sugar and served for breakfast.
        New Orleans is famous for its beignets — particularly those served at
        the iconic Café Du Monde.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Dissolve yeast in warm water. Pour into a large bowl and stir in
          evaporated milk, white sugar, eggs, and salt. Add 4 cups flour and
          beat until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix in shortening. Mix in remaining 3 cups flour. Cover and
          refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll dough out on floured surface to 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 2
          1/2-inch squares.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pot to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Fry beignets in batches until browned and puffed. (If beignets sink
          and do not pop up, oil is not hot enough.) Remove from oil with a
          slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shake confectioners' sugar over hot beignets. Serve immediately.
